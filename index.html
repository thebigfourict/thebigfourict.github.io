		 			<p><b>BasaliTech and Vodacom Foundation</b> has given us much,and the gift that no one can take it from us. Life is really quite an impressive thing that brings together many tribes. The world is such a small domicile that we get a chance to meet with organisations such as BasaliTech and Vodacom Foundation,of which we get an opportunity to know more than we expected. These organisations taught us to be intrepid,happy and also to know how to tackle the difficulties that may occur in the future. Indeed life is really a gift given to us by God because we got to meet with these two impressing organisations. Our mindsets have been sharpened widely and increased the way we put our considerations onto the plater, and for that we are greatful and happy to have known such organisations. Really it was a blessing in disguise. We love you all;BasaliTech and Vodacom Foundation as <b>The Big Four</b> that has been inspired by your work.</p>
